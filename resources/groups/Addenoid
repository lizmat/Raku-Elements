+
infix numeric
numeric add
https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_+
Coerces either side to a C<Numeric> value, and then adds them.

- | −
infix numeric
numeric subtract
https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_-
Coerces both sides to a C<Numeric> value, and then substracts the right
side from the left side.

~
infix string
string concatenation
https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_~
Coerces both sides to a C<Str>, and then concatenates them.

+&
infix integer
integer AND
https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_+&
Coerces both sides to an C<Int> value, and then does a bitwise AND.

+|
infix integer
integer OR
https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_+|
Coerces both sides to an C<Int> value, and then does a bitwise OR.

+^
infix integer
integer XOR
https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_+^
Coerces both sides to an C<Int> value, and then does a bitwise XOR.

~&
infix string
string AND
https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_~&
Coerces both sides to a C<Buffer> value, and then does a bitwise AND
and converts the result back to a C<Str>.
