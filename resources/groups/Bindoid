infix macro
assign value(s)
https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_=_(item_assignment)
Performs an assignment.  The left side is supposed to be either a
C<Scalar>, a C<Positional> with C<Scalar> containers (typically an
C<Array> such as C<my @foo>), or an C<Associative> with C<Scalar>
containers (typically a C<Hash> such as C<my %bar>).
=begin code :lang<raku>
my $a   = 42;
my @foo = 1,2,3,4,5;
my %bar = a => 42, b => 666, c => 137;
=end code

:=
infix macro
bind right value to left lexpad entry
https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_:=
Performs a binding operation on the lexpad entry on the left.  This
is generally done to indicate that it is an immutable value, or if
you want to alias one container to another.
=begin code :lang<raku>
my $b := 42;  # immutable
my $c  = 666;
my $d := $c;  # alias
$d = 137;
say $c;  # 137
=end code


contains all macro-ish infix operators that perform raw binding,
possibly into a container (which would make it an assignment).
